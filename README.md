# My-first-calculator (13.08.2022)
My first GitHub project ever. I made this one in the middle of my JavaScript learning when I learned variables, functions and loops.
It's initially written on Russian language, so Russian-speaking users can watch and test it.

Update from 29.09.22. English version is uploaded and it's available now.

This calculator includes main math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, arithmetic root, exponentiation, sin, cos, tg, ctg.
You need to start HTML.html (or HTML_rus if you want Russian language) then calculator will be run. Enter your numbers in the box and get a result.
